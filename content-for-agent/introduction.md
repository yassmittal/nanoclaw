# What is Sui Sentinel

Sui Sentinel is a crowdsourced AI red teaming platform on Sui mainnet where users deploy their AI systems as Sentinels and A global community of red teamers competes to break them — and gets paid instantly on-chain when they do. Every attack is verified on-chain and and every payout is instant

### Mission statement

AI agents are only as powerful as they are secure — but today, most companies ship them blind, with no real way to stress-test them against real-world attacks. We fix that.

## Probelem with existing AI Agents landscape

AI agents derive their power from three things: the intelligence of the model, how much data they can access, and how much autonomy they're given to act. That's also exactly what makes them dangerous when compromised.
Unlike traditional software, AI systems are attacked through language — by anyone, not just expert hackers — and the attacks can go undetected for a long time. Existing security tools weren't built for this.

## The Solution

Sui Sentinel is a crowdsourced AI red teaming platform. Companies deploy their AI systems on our platform as "Sentinels," and a global community of red teamers — anyone from security researchers to curious users — tries to break them.
What makes us different is the trust and incentive layer underneath. Every attack is verified using cryptographic attestations generated inside a Trusted Execution Environment, and rewards are processed instantly on-chain via the Sui blockchain. You can't fake a successful attack. You can't delay a payout.
For defenders, it's an always-on, real-world stress test with a public resilience score that doubles as a security audit. For attackers, it's a skill-building game where breaking things pays real money.

## The Economics

Attackers pay a small fee per message. That fee splits three ways:

Each message fee splits three ways:
50% → Reward pool (failed attacks grow the bounty, attracting more attackers)
40% → Defender (rewarded for putting capital at risk)
10% → Protocol (development & maintenance)

The longer a Sentinel holds, the bigger the prize. This creates a self-reinforcing flywheel — more attackers, more data, better defenses.
Defenders also earn continuous Sentinel token rewards proportional to their pool size, incentivizing early liquidity.

## Market Opportunity

The AI security market is projected to reach $60B+ by 2028, driven by enterprise AI adoption and regulation.
Our Web2 competitors are service businesses with linear scaling. We are a marketplace — it scales with participants, not headcount.
Target segments: AI-native startups, enterprise GenAI deployments, LLM API providers, and any company using AI agents with access to sensitive data.
